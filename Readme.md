A resource is an entity that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled on the web.


A resource that exists only within another resource can be better represented as a sub-resource instead of a top-level resource in the URL. This makes the relationship clear for the developers using the API.

POST /repos/:owner/:repo/issues Create an issue. GET /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number Retrieve an issue. GET /repos/:owner/:repo/issues List all issues. PATCH /repos/:owner


 Render an action as part of a field of a resource. 
PATCH /repos/saurabhsahni/Hacks HOST api.github.com Content-Type: application/json Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN { "archived": true } 


Treat an action like a sub resource. 
PUT /repos/:owner/:repo/issues/:number/lock locks an issue.

action verb in the API URL. GET /search/code?q=:query: finds files in GitHub matching the given query.

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is one of the simplest API paradigms, in which a client executes a block of code on another server.

High performance protocols that are available for RPC-style APIs, including Apache Thrift and gRPC.


GraphQL is a query language for APIs that has gained significant traction recently.
you do not need different HTTP verbs to describe the operation. Instead, you indicate in the JSON body whether youâ€™re performing a query or a mutation



server needs to do additional processing to parse complex queries and verify parameters. Optimizing performance of GraphQL queries can be difficult, too.
